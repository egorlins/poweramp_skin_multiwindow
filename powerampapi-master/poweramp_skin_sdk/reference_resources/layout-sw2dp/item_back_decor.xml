<!-- Back decor for "usual" item_track
	 NOTE: This is used for "back" button on top of header.
	 This view should be animated from exact location of @id/title to top-right final location.
	 Thus, default scene location should exactly match @id/title location (e.g. with margin offsets), size and other attributes.

		 to match it vs item_track position, it doesn't work reliable for 2 liner
